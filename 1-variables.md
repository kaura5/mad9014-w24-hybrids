1. Declare three meaningfully named variables using different keywords (var, let, const). Explain the differences between them (write in a commnent). Now assign primitive values to each variable. Print the values of these variables to the console.
2. Declare 9 variables of the following data types and then check the data type using the `typeof` operator: `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `bigint`, `symbol`, `object`, `function`, `null`.
3. Declare four meaningfully named variables with const. Assign primitive values to two of them and any kind of Objects to the other two.
4. Copy the following code snippet that declares two variables and then add the code that would let you swap the values inside the two variables. After your code runs the value in first should be 42 and the value in second should be 7. You need to do this without writing the numbers 7 or 42 in your additional code and without using any functions. Use another variable to temporarily hold one of the values while swapping. No functions should be used to do this.
```js
let first = 7;
let second = 42;
```
