For each item, write the function AND the call to the function, passing any required values for testing:
1. Write a function which will accept, `firstName` and `lastName` as argument. Then Concatenate these variables to create a third variable, `fullName`. Print `fullName` to the console. Also return the `fullName`.
2. Write a function that will accept a `randomString` and returns the length of that string.
3. Write a function that accepts a String as an argument and returns the first word from the String in lowercase. Use the `split` method to divide the sentence into words. `Eg: If Hello my name is Jeffrey Lebowski` is sent to the function `hello` would be returned.
4. Create a function that accepts a Number as an argument, converts the `Number` to a `String`, and then uses the `padStart()` method to make sure that the String has at least 20 characters. The filler text is the number zero.
5. Create a function that accepts a String as an argument. It then uses the `includes()` method to determine if the String contains an `@` sign. If it does, then use the `indexOf` method to determine the position in the String of the `@` sign. The function will return false if there is no `@` sign or the position integer if one does exist.
