1. Write a function that accepts three arguments, each with a default value of zero. The function then uses Math.min() or Math.max() to determine which is the largest of the three. Then return the largest of the three numbers.
2. Create a function that creates a random INTEGER between the minimum and maximum values provided as arguments to the function. The random integer needs to be inclusive, which means that if 2 and 5 were provided as the min and max then the random number could be 2, 3, 4, or 5. It includes the min and max values as possibilities. Use Math.random() wrapped in Math.floor() to generate the random integer. Remember that an integer has no decimal value. The general formula / algorithm for calculating a random number is (random value * (max - min)) + min.
3. Declare a variable, randomNumber, and assign it a random integer between 1 and 100 using the Math.random() method. Use the following math methods and print the results:
- Math.round() to round the randomNumber to the nearest integer.
- Math.floor() to round the randomNumber down to the nearest integer.
- Math.ceil() to round the randomNumber up to the nearest integer.
4. Declare a variable, stringNumber, and assign it a numeric value as a string (e.g., "42").
- Use the parseInt() and parseFloat() methods to convert stringNumber to an integer and a floating-point number, respectively.
- Print both converted values to the console.
