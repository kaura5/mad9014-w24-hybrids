# mad9014-w24-hybrids (arrays)
1. Imagine you have a array qith fruit names:
```js
let arr = ['apple', 'orange', 'grapes', 'banana', 'kiwi'];
```
use any three array methods to achieve:
```js
let arr = [ 'apple', 'blueberry', 'grapes', 'banana', 'strawberry' ];
```
For each item, write the function AND the call to the function, passing any required values for testing.
2. Write a function that accepts a single Array of Strings as an argument. The function will create a new Array with all the Strings from the original Array converted to uppercase. Then the function returns the new Array.
3. Write a function that accepts an Array of Strings. The function will use the map() method to create a new array which holds the length of each string. Return the new array with the lengths.
